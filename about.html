    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><strong>Cesare Peli</strong> is a mathematics graduate and educator with a passion for both rigorous theory and creative expression. With degrees in both Mathematics and Performing Arts (DAMS), his work combines analytical precision with a clear, narrative-driven approach to teaching.</p>

    <p>This site is part of a broader educational project aimed at rethinking how mathematics and physics are presented in schools. The goal is to offer materials that are not only technically sound, but also conceptually engaging and visually coherent.</p>

    <p>All materials are designed to support high school teachers and students, blending digital tools (like LaTeX Beamer and Python) with pedagogical clarity and cultural depth.</p>
