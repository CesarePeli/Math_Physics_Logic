# About

_Logic & Motion is more than a resource hub ‚Äî it's a didactic vision._

---

**Cesare Peli** is a mathematics graduate and educator with a passion for both rigorous theory and creative expression.  
With degrees in both **Mathematics** and **Performing Arts (DAMS)**, his work combines analytical precision with a clear, narrative-driven approach to teaching.

This site is part of a broader educational project aimed at rethinking how mathematics and physics are presented in schools.

The goal:  
‚úÖ Materials that are technically sound  
‚úÖ Conceptually engaging  
‚úÖ Visually coherent

---

All resources are designed for high school students and teachers, blending:

- Structured content (LaTeX Beamer)
- Dynamic tools (Python)
- A cultural and pedagogical approach that values clarity, rigor, and creativity
