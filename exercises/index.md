## üé• Introduction to Limits ‚Äì Visual & Intuitive

This introductory presentation explains the concept of limits **without formal definitions** like epsilon-delta. It's ideal for students approaching calculus for the first time, focusing on:

- Left-hand and right-hand limits
- Discontinuities and asymptotes
- Why division by zero leads to infinity
