## 🎥 Introduction to Limits (Intuitive Presentation)

This visual presentation introduces the concept of limits without using formal definitions like epsilon-delta. Through simple examples and geometric reasoning, students learn:

- What it means for a function to “tend” toward a value
- How to read limits from graphs
- Left-hand and right-hand limits
- Discontinuities and vertical asymptotes
- Why division by zero is undefined

It’s an ideal first step before formal calculus. You can view the slides below or click full screen for an immersive experience.
