## 📽️ Introduction to Limits – A Visual & Intuitive Approach

This introductory slideshow helps you understand the concept of limits **without epsilon-delta formalism**. It’s ideal for students who are just starting calculus, and it focuses on:

- The intuitive idea of “getting closer” to a value
- One-sided limits (from the left and right)
- Discontinuities and jumps
- Why division by zero leads to vertical asymptotes
