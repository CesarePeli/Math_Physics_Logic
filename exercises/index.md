### ðŸ“Œ What You'll Learn

This intuitive presentation introduces the concept of limits in calculus without relying on formal definitions like epsilon-delta. Through graphs, simple examples, and geometric interpretations, you'll explore:

- What it means for a function to *tend toward a value* as \( x \) approaches a point
- The difference between left-hand and right-hand limits
- The idea of continuity and how it relates to the limit
- Visualizing asymptotes and infinite limits
- Why division by zero leads to divergence

This guide is perfect for high school and early university students who want to build a conceptual foundation before diving into formal techniques.
