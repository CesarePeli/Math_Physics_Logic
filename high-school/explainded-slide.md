### Introduction to the Concept of Limit

A gentle, intuitive presentation for first-time learners.  
We introduce the notion of limits without using the epsilon-delta definition, relying instead on **graphs**, **simple examples**, and **clear explanations**.

Ideal for students encountering limits for the first time — or for anyone who wants to rebuild their intuition from scratch.
