## üìò What is a Logarithm?

A **logarithm** answers a very specific question:

> *To what power must we raise a given base to obtain a certain number?*

This relationship is written:

$$
\log_a b = x \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad a^x = b
$$

We are used to reading powers from left to right:
- For example:  
  $$ 2^3 = 8 $$

But a logarithm goes in the opposite direction:
- It asks:  
  $$ \log_2 8 = ? $$  
  and answers:  
  $$ \log_2 8 = 3 $$  
  because $$ 2^3 = 8 $$

</div>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When is a Logarithm Defined?

A logarithm like \( \log_a b \) is **only defined** under two conditions:

1. The **base** \( a \) must be **positive** and **different from 1**
2. The **argument** \( b \) must be **positive**

In symbols:

$$
a > 0,\quad a \neq 1,\quad b > 0
$$

Why? Because:
- We can't raise a negative base to arbitrary powers (e.g., roots)
- \( a = 1 \) would always give the same result: \( 1^x = 1 \)
- The result of an exponential function \( a^x \) is always **positive**, so the **inverse** (logarithm) is only defined for positive inputs

## üß† A Step-by-Step Example

Let‚Äôs say we want to solve this exponential equation:

$$
2^x = 5
$$

We ask: "What power of 2 gives 5?"

There is **no integer** that works exactly, so we use logarithms:

$$
x = \log_2 5
$$

This is a **precise** expression, just like \( \sqrt{2} \).  
Its decimal approximation is:

$$
\log_2 5 \approx 2.3219...
$$

This means:
> ‚Äú2 raised to the power 2.3219 is approximately 5.‚Äù

## üîÅ Logarithms and Exponentials: Inverse Functions

The **logarithm base \( a \)** is the inverse of the exponential function base \( a \):

- Exponential:  
  $$ f(x) = a^x $$
- Logarithm:  
  $$ g(x) = \log_a x $$

These functions "undo" each other:

$$
\log_a (a^x) = x \qquad \text{and} \qquad a^{\log_a x} = x
$$

This is similar to how square roots and squaring are inverses:

$$
\sqrt{x^2} = x \qquad \text{and} \qquad (\sqrt{x})^2 = x
$$

</div>

## üìà Graphical Features of the Logarithmic Function

For the function:

$$
f(x) = \log_a x
$$

we know:

- It is defined only for \( x > 0 \)
- It passes through the point \( (1, 0) \), since  
  $$ \log_a 1 = 0 $$
- It increases if \( a > 1 \), and decreases if \( 0 < a < 1 \)
- It grows slowly: logarithms increase very slowly for large values

A classic example:

$$
\log_{10} 1000 = 3 \qquad \text{because} \qquad 10^3 = 1000
$$

But:

$$
\log_{10} 10000 = 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{just one unit more}
$$

So even multiplying by 10 gives only a small change in the logarithm.

## üîß Core Logarithmic Rules

These rules are essential for simplifying logarithmic expressions:

### Product Rule

$$
\log_a (bc) = \log_a b + \log_a c
$$

### Quotient Rule

$$
\log_a \left( \frac{b}{c} \right) = \log_a b - \log_a c
$$

### Power Rule

$$
\log_a (b^n) = n \cdot \log_a b
$$

### Change of Base Formula

To compute logarithms with a base you don‚Äôt have on your calculator:

$$
\log_a b = \frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a}
$$

Most often, we use \( \log_{10} \) or \( \ln \) (log base \( e \)).

## üìù Practice: A Detailed Example

Let‚Äôs simplify this expression:

$$
2 \log x + 3 \log y
$$

We apply the **power rule** first:

$$
= \log(x^2) + \log(y^3)
$$

Now the **product rule**:

$$
= \log(x^2 y^3)
$$

This shows how multiple terms can be **condensed into a single logarithm**.

Another common question:

> What is \( \log_2 \sqrt[3]{16} \) ?

We note:

$$
\sqrt[3]{16} = 2^{4/3}
$$

So:

$$
\log_2(2^{4/3}) = \frac{4}{3}
$$

This uses the rule:

$$
\log_a (a^x) = x
$$

## üîé Want to Go Further?

Try proving these properties from the definition:

- Why does the product rule work?
- Can you explain why logarithms grow slowly?
- Explore the graph of \( y = \log_a x \) for different values of \( a \)

And when you're ready...
