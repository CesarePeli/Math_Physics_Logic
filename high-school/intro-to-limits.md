# Understanding Limits in Calculus

What does it mean to “approach” a number?  
This page offers an intuitive introduction to the concept of **limit**, a central idea in calculus.

We avoid the technicalities of epsilon-delta definitions and instead focus on:
- **Graphs** that show how functions behave near a point
- **Simple, concrete examples**
- **Visual intuition**

Whether you're a high school student or a curious learner, this resource is designed to help you build a **solid conceptual foundation**.
