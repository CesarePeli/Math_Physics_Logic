## What Is a Quadratic Equation?

A **quadratic equation** is an equation where the variable appears with exponent 2:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \qquad \text{with } a \neq 0
$$

It has at most **two real solutions**.

## Common Forms

Some quadratic equations look simpler than others:

- **Standard form:** \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)
- **Pure quadratic:** \( ax^2 + c = 0 \)
- **Spurious quadratic:** \( ax^2 + bx = 0 \)
- **Perfect square:** \( (x + r)^2 = 0 \)

</div>

## Solving Methods

### ‚úÖ Factoring and the Zero Product Property (ZPP)

If the equation can be factored as:

$$
(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0
$$

Then the solutions are:

$$
x = r_1 \quad \text{and} \quad x = r_2
$$

---

### ‚úÖ Quadratic Formula

For any equation in standard form:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

You can use:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

The part under the square root is called the **discriminant**:

$$
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
$$

---

### ‚úÖ How Many Solutions?

- If \( \Delta > 0 \): two real solutions  
- If \( \Delta = 0 \): one real solution (a double root)  
- If \( \Delta < 0 \): no real solution

## Solved Examples

### Example 1

Solve:

$$
x^2 - 9x = 0
$$

Factor:

$$
x(x - 9) = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 9
$$

---

### Example 2

Solve:

$$
x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0
$$

This is a perfect square:

$$
(x + 3)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -3
$$

---

### Example 3

Solve:

$$
2x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0
$$

Use the formula:

$$
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4\cdot2\cdot1}}{2 \cdot 2} =
\frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{1}}{4}
$$

So:

$$
x = -1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -\frac{1}{2}
$$

## Practice Exercises

Try solving the following equations:

1. \( x^2 - 4 = 0 \)  
2. \( x(x - 5) = 0 \)  
3. \( x^2 + 8x + 16 = 0 \)  
4. \( x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0 \)  
5. \( x^2 + x + 1 = 0 \)

---

## Suggested Solutions

1. \( x = -2 \), \( x = 2 \)  
2. \( x = 0 \), \( x = 5 \)  
3. \( x = -4 \)  
4. \( x = 1 \), \( x = -3 \)  
5. ‚ùå No real solutions (discriminant is negative)
