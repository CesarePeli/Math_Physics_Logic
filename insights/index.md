<p><em>Articles, reflections, and conceptual explorations in mathematics and physics</em></p>

<div class="content-box">

  <p>
    This section features original reflections, brief articles, and conceptual explorations in mathematics and physics.  
    The goal is not direct instruction, but to share perspectives, stimulate thought, and highlight interesting questions and structures that go beyond traditional teaching formats.

  <h2>📚 Galileo and Parabolic Motion</h2>
  <p>
    This master's thesis explores the historical and didactic role of mathematical proof in physics,  
    with a focus on Galileo's demonstration of parabolic motion.  
    Developed within the European project <strong>IDENTITIES</strong>, it reflects on the interplay between mathematics, physics, and education — both conceptually and historically.
  </p>

  <h3>Key topics include:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The evolution of the idea of <em>proof</em> from antiquity to modern science</li>
    <li>The role of mathematical reasoning in physics teaching</li>
    <li>Epistemological reflections and interdisciplinary didactics</li>
    <li>A teaching module and a qualitative study on pre-service teacher awareness</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🌌 Blackbody Radiation and the Quantum Revolution</h2>
  <p>
    From infrared glow to the ultraviolet catastrophe: how a mathematical crisis in thermal radiation theory led to the birth of quantum mechanics.  
    This article retraces the journey from Kirchhoff's cavity to Planck’s hypothesis of energy quanta.
  </p>

  <h3>Key topics include:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Historical evolution of blackbody radiation studies</li>
    <li>Mathematical formulation of spectral energy density</li>
    <li>Wien’s displacement law and Stefan–Boltzmann law</li>
    <li>Planck’s revolutionary quantization of energy</li>
