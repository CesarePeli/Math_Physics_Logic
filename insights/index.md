# Scientific Insights

_Articles, reflections, and conceptual explorations in mathematics and physics_

This section features original reflections, brief articles, and conceptual explorations in mathematics and physics. The goal is not direct instruction, but to share perspectives, stimulate thought, and highlight interesting questions and structures that go beyond traditional teaching formats.

## Sample Topics

- Why does the quadratic formula look the way it does?
- From Galileo to Newton: How physical laws became equations
- What makes a mathematical explanation satisfying?
- Geometry as a language: what we really mean by ‚Äúshape‚Äù

New content will be added periodically. You‚Äôre welcome to browse, reflect, and share with colleagues or students.

## Galileo and Parabolic Motion

This master's thesis explores the historical and didactic role of mathematical proof in physics, with a focus on Galileo's demonstration of parabolic motion. Developed within the European project **IDENTITIES**, it reflects on the interplay between mathematics, physics, and education ‚Äî both conceptually and historically.

**Key topics include:**

- The evolution of the idea of _proof_ from antiquity to modern science  
- The role of mathematical reasoning in physics teaching  
- Epistemological reflections and interdisciplinary didactics  
- A teaching module and a qualitative study on pre-service teacher awareness
