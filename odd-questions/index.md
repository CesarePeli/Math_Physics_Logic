# The Odd Questions

_Where curiosity meets contradiction._

Explore some of the most fascinating, strange, and brain-twisting questions from mathematics and physics. These are not just puzzles — they're doorways to deeper understanding.

## ➗ [Why Can’t You Divide by Zero?](/odd-questions/divide-by-zero/)

An accessible explanation of why division by zero isn’t just tricky — it’s actually undefined.

## ♾️ How Much Is ∞ + 1?

It’s still ∞, but not always the **same** ∞. In set theory, there are **different sizes of infinity**, and adding one to a countable infinity changes... nothing.  
But the real question is: _what kind of infinity are you working with_?

## 🐱 Is Schrödinger’s Cat Alive or Dead?

Until you open the box... it’s both. Quantum mechanics says the cat exists in a **superposition** of states until a measurement collapses the wave function.  
It’s weird, yes — but also foundational to modern physics.
