# The Odd Questions

_Where curiosity meets contradiction_

Explore some of the most fascinating, strange, and brain-twisting questions from mathematics and physics. These are not just puzzles — they're doorways to deeper understanding.

---

## Why can’t you divide by zero?

Because it breaks the very logic of arithmetic. Division by zero leads to contradictions such as:  
`1 = 2`  
when manipulating basic equations. It’s not just “undefined” — it’s explosively unstable.

---

## How much is ∞ + 1?

It’s still ∞, but not always the **same** ∞. In set theory, there are **different sizes of infinity**, and adding one to a countable infinity changes... nothing. But the real question is: _what kind of infinity are you working with_?

## Is Schrödinger’s cat alive or dead?

Until you open the box... it’s both. Quantum mechanics says the cat exists in a **superposition** of states until a measurement collapses the wave function. It’s weird, yes — but also foundational to modern physics.

## More to come...

This section will grow with more curious paradoxes, counterintuitive results, and surprising truths from math and science.
