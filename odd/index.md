<h1>The Odd Questions</h1>
<pi<em> Where curiosity meets contradiction.<em></pi>

<div class="content-box">
  

  Explore some of the most fascinating, strange, and brain-twisting questions from mathematics and physics.  
  These are not just puzzles — they're doorways to deeper understanding.

  <h2>➗ Why Can’t You Divide by Zero?</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="/odd/divide-by-zero/">Read the full explanation</a> of why division by zero isn’t just tricky — it’s actually undefined.

  <h2>♾️ What Is Infinity Plus One?</h2>
  <p>
    Adding one to infinity still gives infinity — but not in the way arithmetic would suggest.  
    Through Hilbert’s Hotel and the logic of set theory, we discover that infinity is not a number, but a <strong>concept</strong> — one that changes meaning depending on the context.

  <h2>🐱 Is Schrödinger’s Cat Alive or Dead?</h2>
  <p>
    Until you open the box... it’s both.  
    Quantum mechanics says the cat exists in a <strong>superposition</strong> of states until a measurement collapses the wave function.  
    It’s weird, yes — but also foundational to modern physics.
