  <h2>♾️ What Is Infinity Plus One?</h2>
  <p>
    Adding one to infinity still gives infinity — but not in the way arithmetic would suggest.  
    Through Hilbert’s Hotel and the logic of set theory, we discover that infinity is not a number, but a <strong>concept</strong> — one that changes meaning depending on the context.
