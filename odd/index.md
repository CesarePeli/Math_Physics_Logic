# The Odd Questions

_Where curiosity meets contradiction._

Explore some of the most fascinating, strange, and brain-twisting questions from mathematics and physics.  
These are not just puzzles — they're doorways to deeper understanding.

## ➗ [Why Can’t You Divide by Zero?](/odd/divide-by-zero/)

An accessible explanation of why division by zero isn’t just tricky — it’s actually undefined.

## ♾️ [What Is Infinity Plus One?](/odd/infinity-plus-one/)

Adding one to infinity still gives infinity — but not in the way arithmetic would suggest.  
Through Hilbert’s Hotel and the logic of set theory, we discover that infinity is not a number, but a **concept** — one that changes meaning depending on the context.

## 🐱 Is Schrödinger’s Cat Alive or Dead?

Until you open the box... it’s both.  
Quantum mechanics says the cat exists in a **superposition** of states until a measurement collapses the wave function.  
It’s weird, yes — but also foundational to modern physics.
