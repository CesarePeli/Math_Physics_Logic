  <h2>üéì Philosophy of Use</h2>
  <p>
    These materials aim to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Emphasize <strong>understanding over memorization</strong></li>
    <li>Highlight <strong>connections between topics</strong></li>
    <li>Provide <strong>models, not just solutions</strong></li>
    <li>Foster a mindset of <strong>clarity, logic, and depth</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All content is screen-optimized and available in PDF format, suitable for tablets, laptops, and projection.
