# University

![University cover](/images/university-bg.jpg){: .full-width }

A curated collection of **university-level exercises** with concise **theory recalls**.  
All materials are authored and reviewed by **university professors**, ensuring both scientific rigor and pedagogical clarity.

## How it works
- **Theory recap first:** short, essential reminders of definitions, theorems, and methods.  
- **Exercises next:** graded problems (from fundamentals to exam-style), with clear, step-by-step reasoning.  
- **Focus on structure:** ideas and logical flow come before rote procedures.

## Tracks
