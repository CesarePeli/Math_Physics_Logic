# University

Concise **theory recalls** followed by **graded exercises**, authored and reviewed by university lecturers and researchers.

## Tracks

- **[University Mathematics](/university/math/)** — curated by **Prof. De Martino**, *Researcher in Mathematics at Politecnico di Milano* (Italy’s largest technical university, renowned for engineering, architecture, and applied sciences).

- **[University Physics](/university/physics/)** — curated by **Prof. Dr. Marco Ruzzi**, *Associate Professor at the University of Padua* (one of Europe’s oldest universities, with a long-standing tradition in science and medicine).

### How to use these notes
- **Read the short theory recap**, then attempt the problems in order.  
- **Compare with step-by-step solutions** to check reasoning, not only results.  
- **Follow cross-links** between topics when concepts overlap.
