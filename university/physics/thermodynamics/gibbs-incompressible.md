# Gibbs Free Energy for Incompressible Substances

<div class="content-box">

## Theoretical Background

- **Definition of Gibbs free energy:**
  $$
  G = H - TS
  $$

- Differential form:
  $$
  dG = V\,dp - S\,dT
  $$

- For an **isothermal process** ($dT = 0$):
  $$
  dG = V\,dp
  $$

- If the substance is **incompressible** (constant $V$):
  $$
  \Delta G = V\,(p_2 - p_1)
  $$

ðŸ‘‰ This shows that for liquids and solids, pressure has a **linear effect** on Gibbs free energy, unlike gases where the relation is logarithmic.

## Exercise

For **1.00 L of liquid water** at $25^\circ C$, calculate the change in Gibbs free energy when pressure increases from **1 bar to 100 bar**, assuming water is incompressible with molar volume $V_m = 18.0 \times 10^{-6}\, m^3 mol^{-1}$.

## Step-by-Step Solution

**Step 1. Number of moles**  
From the total volume and the molar volume:
$$
n = \frac{V}{V_m} = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-3}\, m^3}{18.0 \times 10^{-6}\, m^3 mol^{-1}} = 55.6\, mol
$$

**Step 2. Pressure change**  
$$
\Delta p = p_2 - p_1 = (100 - 1)\, bar = 99\, bar
$$

Convert to SI units:  
$$
1\, bar = 10^5\, Pa \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta p = 99 \times 10^5 = 9.9 \times 10^6\, Pa
$$

---

**Step 3. Gibbs free energy change**  
Use $\Delta G = n V_m \Delta p$:  
$$
\Delta G = (55.6)(18.0 \times 10^{-6})(9.9 \times 10^6)\, J
$$

$$
\Delta G = 9900\, J \;\approx 9.9\, kJ
$$

---

**Final Answer:**  
$$
\Delta G \approx 9.9\, kJ
$$

## Notes

- The calculation shows that for liquids, $\Delta G$ is proportional to the pressure change.  
- Even a large increase in pressure (from 1 bar to 100 bar) only changes $\Delta G$ by **a few kJ** because the molar volume is small.  
- For gases, the relation is instead:
  $$
  G = G^\circ + RT \ln \frac{p}{p^\circ}
  $$
  which grows logarithmically with $p$.  
- This distinction explains why **pressure strongly influences gas equilibria**, but has only minor effects on liquid or solid phases.
