# Ideal-Gas Processes — Work, $\Delta U$ and $\Delta S$

<div class="content-box">

## Theoretical Background

- **Equation of state:** $pV = nRT$.  
- **Internal energy of an ideal gas:** $U = U(T)$, so $\Delta U$ depends only on the temperature change.  
- **Isothermal process:** $\Delta U = 0$.  
- **Work in a reversible isothermal:**  
  $$
  w = nRT \ln\!\left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right).
  $$
- **Entropy change (reversible):**  
  $$
  \Delta S = nR \ln\!\left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right).
  $$
- **State vs path functions:** $\Delta U$ and $\Delta S$ depend only on initial and final states, while $w$ and $q$ depend on the path.

## Exercise

A sample of $n = 100\,\text{mol}$ of ideal hydrogen at $T = 300\,\text{K}$ is compressed from  
$V_1 = 4.0\,\text{m}^3$ to $V_2 = 2.0\,\text{m}^3$.

Calculate the work **on** the gas along three different reversible paths:  

1. **(a)** Isobaric compression (at $p_1$) followed by isochoric cooling to the final state.  
2. **(b)** Direct isothermal compression from $V_1$ to $V_2$.  
3. **(c)** Isochoric heating to $p_2$, followed by isobaric compression at $p_2$.

Then evaluate $\Delta U$ and $\Delta S$, and compare results.

## Step-by-Step Solution

**Step 1. Calculate initial and final pressures**  
From $pV = nRT$:
$$
p_1 = \frac{nRT}{V_1}, \qquad p_2 = \frac{nRT}{V_2}.
$$
With $nRT = 2.494\times 10^5\,\text{J}$,  
$p_2 = 2p_1$.

**Step 2. Work for each path**

- **(a) Isobaric (at $p_1$):**  
  $$
  w_a = p_1(V_2 - V_1) = nRT\!\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1} - 1\right).
  $$
  Numerically: $w_a = 1.247\times 10^5\,\text{J}$.

- **(b) Isothermal:**  
  $$
  w_b = nRT \ln\!\left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) 
       = 2.494\times10^5 \ln(0.5).
  $$
  $w_b = 1.729\times 10^5\,\text{J}$.

- **(c) Isobaric (at $p_2$):**  
  $$
  w_c = p_2(V_2 - V_1) = 2p_1(V_2 - V_1) = 2 w_a.
  $$
  $w_c = 2.494\times 10^5\,\text{J}$.

**Step 3. Internal energy change**  
Since $T$ is the same at initial and final state:
$$
\Delta U = 0.
$$

---

**Step 4. Entropy change**  
Use the isothermal reference (reversible):
$$
\Delta S = nR \ln\!\left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right).
$$
Numerically:
$$
\Delta S = 100(8.314)\ln(0.5) = -5.76\times 10^2\,\text{J K}^{-1}.
$$

## Notes and Discussion

- The **work** depends on the path:  
  $w_a < w_b < w_c$.  
  This illustrates that work is **path-dependent**.

- The **internal energy** change is zero for all cases because $U$ of an ideal gas depends only on $T$.

- The **entropy** decreases, consistent with the system becoming more ordered upon compression.  
  This is a **state function**, so the same value emerges regardless of path.

- **Important remark:**  
  Always check whether $\Delta U=0$ holds:  
  it is true here because the process is isothermal and the gas is ideal. For real gases this statement is **not exact**.
