# Phase Transitions — Interpreting a Heating Curve


<div class="content-box">


## Exercise — Water from solid to vapor
For a one‑mole sample at $p=1\,\text{bar}$, interpret the segments of a typical heating curve from ice to steam. Show that horizontal segments correspond to $\Delta H_{\text{fus}}^\circ$ and $\Delta H_{\text{vap}}^\circ$, and that the slopes in single‑phase regions are the reciprocals of $C_{p,m}$.


**Solution (outline).** During phase changes $T=\text{const}\Rightarrow q=\Delta H$ at constant $p$, giving plateaus with lengths proportional to the molar latent heats. In single phases, $q=\int C_{p,m}\,dT$, hence $\Delta T = q/C_{p,m}$; plotting $T$ vs supplied heat shows slopes $dT/dq=1/C_{p,m}$ for solid, liquid, and vapor regions.
